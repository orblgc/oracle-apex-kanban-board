# Kanban Board Component for Oracle APEX

![Preview](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/orblgc/oracle-apex-kanban-board/refs/heads/main/preview.png)

This Kanban Board component is inspired by the **Material Kanban Board Plugin**, using it as a UI (HTML-CSS) reference. You can see the inspired plugin [here](https://github.com/McRange/Material-Kanban-Board).

Unlike the original Material Kanban Board Plugin which is implemented as a **Region Type**, this component is built as a **Template Component Type**, providing more flexibility and better integration within APEX.

## Key Features

- **Drag and Drop**: Implemented using the `dragula` JavaScript library.
- **Auto Scroll During Drag**: Enabled by the `dom-auto-scroll` library to improve the user experience during long board drags.
- **High Performance**: Thanks to its lightweight and efficient implementation, the component performs exceptionally well even with many cards.
- **Oracle APEX Integration**:
  - Fully compatible with **Faceted Search**
  - Supports **Pagination**
